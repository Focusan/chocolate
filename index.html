                  <p>Dear Fellow Chocolate Lover:</p>
                  <p>I admit it! I confess! I am a chocoholic. Put any kind of chocolate in front of me and I simply cannot resist. If you feel the same way and simply cannot get enough of that rich, chocolaty goodness then there&rsquo;s a new e-book that was written just for you. </p>
                  <p>I don&rsquo;t remember a time in my life when I haven&rsquo;t loved chocolate. You name it: chocolate cake, chocolate pie, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate fudge, chocolate pudding, chocolate fondue&hellip;if it has chocolate in it I love it. </p>
                  <p>In fact, over the years I have collected tons of cookbooks just for the chocolate recipes. The only problem is that I was beginning to run out of room on my cookbook shelf for all those books. Even worse, I never could remember which cookbook contained the recipe I wanted whenever I got ready to make one of my favorite chocolate dishes. </p>
                  <p>I tried the sticky note method, but then I had what seemed like hundreds of little pieces of paper sticking out of my cookbooks and it still didn&rsquo;t help me any. I couldn&rsquo;t find my favorite chocolate recipes when I needed them! Something had to be done!</p>
                  <p>I realized that if I just had one central location for all of my chocolate recipes, my life would be much simpler. I could find my favorite recipes easily and quickly without having to thumb through dozens of cookbooks. I considered copying down all of my favorite recipes onto index cards and placing them a recipe file box, but them it occurred to me that perhaps that wouldn&rsquo;t be the best way to handle it. That would be a lot of writing by hand and I would have to stay on top of keeping the cards filed correctly or else I would still have problems finding the right recipe when I needed it. </p>
                  <p>That&rsquo;s when I decided to type up all my favorite chocolate recipes and organize them categorically. It took me awhile to get them all typed up and organized just right, but when I was done I was simply amazed. </p>
                  <p align="center" class="style23">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t way to step into my kitchen and whip up something rich and decadent!&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>To say that I had fun with my newly organized chocolate recipes would be an understatement. Suddenly, it was so much easier than ever to put my fingers on exactly the recipe I wanted when I needed it. No more flipping through multiple cookbooks. No more trying to remember if I recipe was under the Cakes section or Desserts section. It was all right there, nice and handy. </p>
                  <p align="center" class="style23">&ldquo;Suddenly I couldn&rsquo;t stop baking!&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>I began to bake up a storm. Cookies. Pies. Cakes. Candy. I even mixed up specialty chocolate drinks for my friends when they came to visit. It was as easy as 1,2,3 because I could grab the recipes I wanted when I needed them. My friends were absolutely amazed. Of course, they had known what a chocolate addict I was for a long time. Most of them even teased me about it mercilessly. </p>
                  <p>At first, they thought it was funny that I had gone to so much trouble to organize all of my chocolate recipes. That is, until they realized how handy it is to have all of them in one central place. Then they began to ask for copies of my recipe collection. </p>
                  <p align="center" class="style23">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I realized I was onto something.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>Why not offer my chocolate recipe collection to others and make their life a little easier too? And while I was at it why not share my extensive knowledge about chocolate and how it came to be such a delicious and decadent treat in the first place? </p>
                  <p>If you want to learn how to enjoy the rich, velvety taste of chocolate even more than ever, or if you love create decadent chocolate creations to share with friends and family, or if you want to learn more about how chocolate can actually be healthy for you, then this book is for you. <br>

     <p align="center" class="style23">Okay, I&rsquo;m sold, but what&rsquo;s this incredible resource going to cost me?</p>
     <p>When I first began to think about putting my chocolate recipes on the market, my first thought was to simply print it in a booklet format that I could drop in the mail. I realized; however, that method would seriously limit the number of people that I would be able to share this incredible resource with. </p>
     <p>In addition, I would have to charge quite a bit to cover the printing costs. That&rsquo;s not something I wanted to do. I wanted everyone to be able to enjoy my recipe collection for a reasonable price. </p>
     <p>So, I decided to offer my incredible collection of chocolate recipes and facts in the form of an e-book. This would allow me to make it more widely available and I could also offer it for a lower price. So, you can now take advantage of <em><strong>Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes</strong></em> for only $37. <br>
